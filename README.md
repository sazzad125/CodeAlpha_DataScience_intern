###CodeAlpha Data Science Internship
##Overview
The CodeAlpha Data Science Internship, offered by CodeAlpha, a leading software development company specializing in data-driven innovation and AI solutions, provides hands-on experience in data science, machine learning, and statistical modeling. Interns work with Python and libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models. The program includes expert mentorship and practical projects to develop skills for solving real-world problems. This repository contains the implementation of three assigned tasks: Iris Flower Classification, Unemployment Analysis with Python, and Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning.

###Project Overview
##Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

#Objective: Train a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on measurements like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
#Dataset: The Iris dataset, accessible via scikit-learn or downloadable from CodeAlpha.
#Methodology:
Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
Perform EDA to understand feature distributions and correlations.
Preprocess data (e.g., split into training and testing sets, scale features).
Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or SVM).
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Visualize results with scatter plots or decision boundaries.


#Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
#Outputs: Trained model, performance metrics, visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix, feature scatter plots).
#Key Insight: The model achieves high accuracy due to the well-separated nature of Iris species, demonstrating basic classification concepts.

##Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python

#Objective: Analyze unemployment rate trends in India, focusing on the impact of COVID-19, using data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
#Dataset: Unemployment in India.csv, containing 768 entries with columns like Region, Date, Estimated Unemployment Rate (%), Estimated Employed, Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%), and Area (Rural/Urban). Download from CodeAlpha.
#Methodology:
Clean data by removing 28 missing rows and standardizing column names.
Convert Date to datetime and extract month and year for temporal analysis.
Perform EDA to compute statistics (e.g., mean unemployment rate: 11.79%, max: 76.74%).
Visualize monthly unemployment trends using line plots with markers.
Save cleaned dataset to Cleaned_Unemployment_India.csv.


#Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
#Outputs: Cleaned dataset, line plot of unemployment trends.
#Key Insight: Extreme unemployment rates (e.g., 76.74%) suggest significant economic disruptions, likely due to COVID-19 lockdowns, with clear seasonal and regional patterns.

##Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

#Objective: Build a regression model to predict used car selling prices based on features like brand, mileage, and age.
#Dataset: car_data.csv, containing 301 entries with columns like Car_Name, Year, Selling_Price, Present_Price, Driven_kms, Fuel_Type, Selling_type, Transmission, and Owner. Download from CodeAlpha.
#Methodology:
#Engineer features: Extract Brand from Car_Name, calculate Age (2025 - Year).
#Preprocess data: Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables (Fuel_Type, Selling_type, Transmission, Brand), split into 80% training and 20% testing sets, and scale numerical features.
Train a LinearRegression model.
Evaluate using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score.
Visualize actual vs. predicted prices and residuals.
Save model to car_price_model.pkl and predictions to predictions.csv using joblib.


#Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, joblib.
#Outputs: Trained model, predictions CSV, scatter and residual plots.
#Key Insight: The model predicts prices with reasonable accuracy, but high dimensionality from Brand encoding suggests potential for feature selection or advanced models (e.g., Random Forest).

##Requirements
To run the projects, install the following Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib

#How to Run

Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeAlpha_Data_Science_Internship.git


Navigate to the respective project folder (e.g., CodeAlpha_Car_Price_Prediction).
Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook.
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:jupyter notebook <Notebook_Name>.ipynb


Install required libraries (see Requirements).
Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
Load and preprocess data.
Perform EDA and visualization.
Train and evaluate models.
Save outputs (models, predictions, plots).


#Outputs:
Visualizations (e.g., line plots, scatter plots, residual plots).
Saved models and predictions (for Tasks 1 and 3).
Cleaned dataset (for Task 2).



#Submission Guidelines

Upload each project’s source code to a GitHub repository named CodeAlpha_ProjectName (e.g., CodeAlpha_Car_Price_Prediction).
Post a video explanation of each project on LinkedIn, including the GitHub repository link and tagging @CodeAlpha.
Submit the GitHub repository link and video link via the CodeAlpha Submission Form.
Ensure completion of at least 2 or 3 tasks within the specified time frame.

#Notes

#Task 1: The Iris dataset is small and well-structured, making it ideal for learning classification techniques. Consider experimenting with multiple models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) to compare performance.
#Task 2: The unemployment dataset includes outliers (e.g., 76.74% unemployment rate), which may require further investigation. Regional or urban/rural analysis could enhance insights.
#Task 3: The high number of brands (98) in the car dataset increases dimensionality after one-hot encoding. Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) or alternative models could improve performance.
The projects demonstrate core data science skills: data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and model building, with real-world applications in classification, economic analysis, and price prediction.
